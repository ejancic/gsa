            "Brenda Gray served as controller to a company where I was a V.P for 10 years. She served in an
            environment where her capabilities and qualifications were refined and polished. She was always
            a pleasure to work with. She was resourceful and solid in her desire and ability to find solutions.
            I relied on her ethics and answers. I support her business venture with enthusiasm."
        </p>
        <h6>- Becky Daniel | President, Austin Group Resources</h6>
        <p>
            "Having worked with Brenda Gray in two different professional settings, as well as for personal
            business, I am excited to recommend her work.  Brenda is very knowledgeable in her field, looks
            at the big picture while making sure to assess the many details of every project.  Brenda is a
            team-player and is always aware of the needs of the business and the people with whom she works.
            Her skills with budgeting, projections, payroll, taxes, and accounts receivable are top of the line."

            "The Principals of Integrity Partners, a leading firm in delivering fraud and risk management
            solutions, first met Brenda Gray in 2007 when she was the Director of Financial Services for Crime
            Stoppers of Houston.  We were expanding our business and needed an experienced book-keeper and was
            provided "Bill Quick" software to learn and customize for Integrity Partners use.  Her work is efficient,
            effective, and has significantly reduced the time required to do our billing."
