            "Brenda Gray served as controller to a company where I was a V.P for 10 years. She served in an
            environment where her capabilities and qualifications were refined and polished. She was always
            a pleasure to work with. She was resourceful and solid in her desire and ability to find solutions.
            I relied on her ethics and answers. I support her business venture with enthusiasm."

            "Having worked with Brenda Gray in two different professional settings, as well as for personal
            business, I am excited to recommend her work.  Brenda is very knowledgeable in her field, looks
            at the big picture while making sure to assess the many details of every project.  Brenda is a
            team-player and is always aware of the needs of the business and the people with who she works.
            Her skills with budgeting, projections, payroll, taxes, and accounts receivable are top of the line."
